    <h3>Sustainable Wedding</h3>
    <div class="sustain-text-wrap">
      <p>
        Two non-maritalist people made their mind to take on a marriage in this
        time of a long-foreseen catastrophe. Although humanity and the world is
        a step closer to their end, Saerom & Jaeyong have decided to share with
        next generations the fact that there are still people who take efforts
        for a better world!
      </p>

      <p>
        With sustainability in mind, the marriage of Saerom & Jaeyong is not
        merely done not as a marriage of a son and a daughter of their parents.
        It is a new start of two individuals as a team and as your colleagues
        and friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wedding takes place at a public park that Seoul City Government
        provides to citizens for no cost. The wedding attires are bought on a
        second-hand market. The wedding will take place with as few disposable
        items as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        These efforts can never be perfect. Nevertheless, with this wedding, we
        would like to share our thoughts and concerns on the sustainability of
        relations, sustainability of life, sustainability of stories, and
        sustainability of our environment and the world. Beyond everything, we
        would like to invite all of you to imagine the future within the present
        that we are making.
